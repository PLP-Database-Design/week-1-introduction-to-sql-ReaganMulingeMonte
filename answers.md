 Components of a DBMS
Hardware: Physical devices like servers and storage devices.
Software: DBMS software like MySQL or Oracle DB.
Data: Information stored and managed by the DBMS.
Procedures: Instructions and rules to design, use, and manage databases.
Users: People interacting with the database, such as admins and end-users.

--question 2
A relational database organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns, using keys to establish relationships.

MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle Database
Microsoft SQL Server

--question 3
Classifications of SQL
DDL (Data Definition Language): Defines and modifies database structures (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
DML (Data Manipulation Language): Handles data retrieval and manipulation (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
DCL (Data Control Language): Manages access and permissions (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).
--question 4
 Difference Between Primary Key and Foreign Key
Primary Key: A unique identifier for records in a table.
Foreign Key: A field in one table referencing the Primary Key in another table to establish relationships.
--question 5
 Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
A visual representation of entities, their attributes, and relationships within a database. ERDs help in designing database structures.
--question6
 Advantages of Relational Databases
Data Integrity: Maintains consistency and accuracy.
Flexibility: Easy to add, update, or remove data.
Scalability: Can handle large volumes of data.
Security: Offers user access controls and permissions.
--question 7
Types of Data Types Used in Tables
INT: Stores integers.
VARCHAR: Stores variable-length text.
DATE: Stores date values.
BOOLEAN: Stores true/false values.
--question 8
Purpose of a DBMS
To provide an efficient, reliable, and secure way to store, retrieve, and manage data in applications. It centralizes data management and ensures integrity, accessibility, and consistency.
